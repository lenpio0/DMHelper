## DM Helper

DM Helper is a website app, a tool for RPG tabletop games. It let's you create characters and tables, and to give thems spells, items and more that you can edit or remove as you need. It serves as a way to keep tracks of ever changing data without having to torture you character sheet. That also means that you don't actually need your sheet to play, a photo for example is enough as users keeps their characters and tables data between sessions.
Users can either be DM to create and manage tables , or players to create and keep track of characters.

DM Helper is actually only available for private use, as it still needs some tweaking to be publicly usable.
